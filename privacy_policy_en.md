# Archive Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-02-10

This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application "Archive" (the "App").

## 1. What Data We Process

### 1.1 Notes and Local Database

- Notes you create in the App (such as title, content, and timestamps) are stored locally on your device.
- The App uses local database/storage mechanisms to process this data.
- We do not automatically upload your notes to our servers.

### 1.2 Backup and Restore Data

- When you actively use the backup/restore feature, the App reads/writes backup files at locations you choose (e.g., system document folders).
- Backup files are encrypted with the backup password you set.
- Auto-backup runs only if you explicitly enable it.

### 1.3 Settings and Preferences

- The App stores necessary settings locally, such as theme, biometric toggle, backup directory, auto-backup switch/interval, and last backup info.
- These settings are used only for app functionality, not for ad profiling.

### 1.4 Biometric Authentication

- The App may invoke system biometric authentication for unlock/verification.
- Biometric templates are managed by the device OS; the App does not directly collect or store your raw biometric data.

## 2. What We Do Not Do

- No ad SDK integration and no ad tracking.
- No third-party analytics SDKs (based on current code and permissions).
- No automatic upload of your note content to developer-operated servers.

## 3. Permissions

The current version mainly uses:

- `android.permission.VIBRATE`: used for haptic feedback.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

- Your data is stored on your device by default, and retention is controlled by you.
- You may delete data by uninstalling the App, deleting notes, and/or deleting backup files.
- Backup files are stored in locations you choose and are managed by you.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended to collect children's personal information. If you believe improper processing occurred, please contact the developer.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date will be updated accordingly.
